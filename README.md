  <strong>Armbian Config: The Next Generation</strong><br>
<br>


## What is armbian-config?

`armbian-config` is an interactive configuration utility for Armbian-based systems, designed to help users configure their device **after it has been installed and booted**. It provides a menu-driven interface for managing system settings, software, hardware, and services **within the running system ("image-space")**.


## about

This tool is optimized for use with [**Armbian Linux**](https://www.armbian.com), but in theory, it should also work on any systemd-based, APT-compatible Linux distribution â€” including Linux Mint, Elementary OS, Kali Linux, MX Linux, Parrot OS, Proxmox, Raspberry Pi OS, and others.

#### General

- `armbian-config` operates **only in image-space**. It is **not** used during the image build process and does **not** affect image creation or customization at build time.
- If you wish to change the default contents, packages, or configurations included in an Armbian image before it is built, those changes must be made in the [Armbian build scripts](https://github.com/armbian/build), **not** in `armbian-config`.
- Feature requests or bug reports for `armbian-config` should be limited to things that can be changed or applied **within image-space** (i.e., on a running system), not during image creation or build time.
