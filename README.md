  <strong>Armbian Config: The Next Generation V3</strong><br>
  <br>
</p>

# armbian-config (config-v3)

## Overview

**armbian-config** is a system configuration tool for Armbian-based systems. It helps users set up and manage system settings through a simple, interactive interface.

It supports command-line (CLI) and text user interfaces (TUI).

---

## Scope and Responsibilities

- **armbian-config operates only in image-space.**  
  It is used exclusively on a running Armbian system and does **not** participate in the image build process. It does **not** affect image creation or customization at build time.

- **Image build changes belong to the build scripts.**  
  If you wish to change the default contents, packages, or configurations included in an Armbian image before it is built, those changes must be made in the Armbian build scriptsâ€”not in armbian-config.

- **Limit feature requests and bug reports to image-space actions.**  
  Feature requests or bug reports for armbian-config should only involve tasks that can be changed or applied on a running system. Requests relating to image creation or build-time customization should be directed to the Armbian build system.

## What armbian-config (config-v3) **Is**

- **A Framework for System Configuration:**  
  Provides a collection of reusable Bash modules and helpers for managing and automating configuration tasks on Armbian systems.

- **Interface-Agnostic:**  
  Separates backend configuration logic from user interface code, enabling the same procedures to be accessed via CLI, TUI (text user interface), and future GUI implementations.

- **Modular and Extensible:**  
  Encourages the use of distinct, well-documented modules for each configuration area, facilitating easier maintenance and contribution.

- **Testable:**  
  Built with unit testing and automation in mind, allowing for reliable operation and easier validation of changes.

- **Documentation-Focused:**  
  Provides extensive documentation and in-line help for modules and commands, lowering the barrier for both users and contributors.

---

## Goals

- **Migrate and Refactor:**  
  Transition legacy code and features into a standard, modern development structure.

- **Promote Code Reuse:**  
  Encourage modular, reusable Bash code for consistent configuration handling.

- **Enable Testing:**  
  Facilitate robust unit and integration testing for all modules and helpers.

- **Support Automation and Multiple UIs:**  
  Clean separation of backend configuration from interface logic to allow for both automation and various user-facing interfaces.
